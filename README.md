# Dotfiles â€” Arch Linux, Your Way

Welcome to the configuration nexus. This repository houses my complete setup for a modular, keyboard-driven Linux experience. Optimized for **Arch Linux**, tiling window managers, and high-efficiency workflows.

> Note: These dotfiles are tuned for users who know their way around a terminal. No hand-holding, just clean configs and composability.
